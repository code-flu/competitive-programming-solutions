The City of Wonderland is under attack by an unknown virus. There are twenty-six types of people who reside in the city of Wonderland i.e every person in the city belongs to any one of the types from a - z.


Many people have got infected by the virus and are fighting for their lives. Scientists have studied the virus and its impact on different types of people. After their study, they found that the virus is unable to cause damage to any of the people who belong to the type that is maximum in the city.


For example - If in the city, the maximum people belong to the type b, then all b types of people will be safe from the virus.


Scientists want to know the type for which the people are maximum so that they can safeguard them and also develop vaccination as an antidote to the virus which will provide immunity to other people. They are short of time and therefore need your help in determining the type for which the people are maximum in the city. 



Note: If there are more than one type of people with equal maximum then the type with lesser ASCII value will be considered.



Can you help the scientists in saving the city?
