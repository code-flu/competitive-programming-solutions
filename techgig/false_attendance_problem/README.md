**The false attendance problem**

Miss Claire teaches English in the college, St. Xavierâ€™s, and notices that in the last few lectures the turn out in the class is not equal to the number of attendance. The annual college fest is going on and as a result, students are not interested in attending classes. Students are enjoying the college fest and sometimes, they do proxies for their friends. Some students have been helping their friends this way,

One day, as usual someone called a proxy but Miss Claire was vigilant and could identify the student on hearing his voice. On apprehending the student, the student denied any wrong doing. Miss Claire let it go but came up with a brilliant idea to mark attendance for those students who were actually present in the class.

As per her idea, Miss Claire brought a voice identifying instrument. The purpose of this instrument was to record and save the voice of students as per their roll numbers. On playing the recording later, the instrument would identify the roll number to which the voice was attached. When the process is complete, the instrument would provide a list which would include the count of distinct voices. The students had no idea about this device and were all prepared to call their proxies as they had been doing. Miss Claire does the usual task of taking attendance. The instrument does its job of providing her with a list.

Miss Claire gives the job of identifying the roll numbers of students who were absent in the class to you. She gives you the list which the instrument provided. Your job is to provide Miss Claire with the roll number of absent students in ascending order.

**Note:**  There is at least one student in the class who is absent.
