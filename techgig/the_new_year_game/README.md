A group of N friends is partying hard at a pub. They love Bira and have been enjoying their time.

The pub has decided to play games with the groups in the pub. The pub has placed B cartons of Bira at point S (Source).
The weight of different cartons may or may not be the same. A person can move from point S to point D (Destination) in 
one minute. The pub wants the groups to transfer all Bira cartons from source point to the destination point.

There are a few rules for the game which have to be followed.
- A single person can carry a single carton at a time.
- A person cannot carry a carton with the weight greater than his/her weight. 
The weight of the carton is written on the carton and all the people know their weights.
- There is no limitation on the times a person transfers the cartons. 
It means a single person can carry all the cartons if possible but for each carton he/she will have to come back to the source point S from destination point D which will take a minute.

To win all the cartons of Bira, the group has to transfer all the cartons of Bira in the minimum time possible.

Note: Initially, the people and Bira cartons are present at the source.
It is possible that the sequence of people carrying weight may change or 
adopt different strategy but the minimum time possible will remain the same. 
Also, it is always possible to transfer all the Bira cartons from source point to the destination point.
