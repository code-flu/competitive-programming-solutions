Harry is known as the mathematician of his school, so today he has been given a number N by one of his friends and his friend asks him to generate the smallest number possible by changing atmost K digits of this number. What is the minimum value that Harry can make from this number?
Note: Neither the given number has leading zeroes nor the generated number can have leading zeroes.


Input Format
The first line of the input contains the number N, the length of the number L.
The second line of input contains L.
The third line of input contains K.


Constraints
1≤ N ≤200000
0 ≤ K ≤ L


Output Format
Print the minimum value that can be generated from the given number after changing atmost K digits.
Note: The generated value should also also have N digits.
