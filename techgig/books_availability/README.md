### Books Availability

Raju is an intelligent boy of the class. One day, his teacher called him and gave him a task to perform. His task is to tell the index of the row in the class where the total sum of the books that the students have is maximum.

  

Raju is finding it difficult to solve and seeks your help for the same. Can you help Raju?

  

Note: There will be equal number of rows and columns i.e ( N==M). Indexing will be counted from 0 to n-1. If there are more than one rows with the same maximum sum then print the row with greater index.

  
  

##### Input Format

The first line of input consists of an integer N, which denotes number of rows and columns.

Next N lines each will consists of N space-separated integers denoting the number of books with the particular student.

  

Note: It is a N*N matrix.  

  
  

##### Constraints

1<=N<=1000

0<=Matrix[i][j]<=1000

  
  

##### Output Format

Print a single integer i.e., the index of the row having maximum sum of books.  
  

###### Sample TestCase 1

Input

3

1 0 0

2 3 4

1 90 0

Output

2

###### Explanation

Sum of all the books in row 0 = 1+0+0 = 1  
Sum of all the books in row 1 = 2+3+4 = 9  
Sum of all the books in row 2 = 1+90+0 = 91  
  
So, the index having maximum sum is 2 i.e., 91.
