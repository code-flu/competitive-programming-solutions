There are 4 Cricketers who have contacted Mr. Ski and each of them has different requirements. A cricketer will only be interested in a bat with a weight greater than his requirment and he can spend maximum money of bat price.


Example:
Consider the following 4 requirements..
weight |  price
5        100
7        80
10       90
6        150
And consider the following 4 bats.
weight | price
8        100
10       150
9        60
7        80

Following this, respective cricketers would be interested in the following bats:
Cricketer 1: Weight of Bat should be greater than 5. 
Maximum money he can spend = 100. So, Bats he would be interested in are Bat [8 100], Bat [9 60] and Bat [7 80].

Cricketer 2: Weight of Bat should be greater than 7. 
Maximum money he can spend = 80. So, He would only be interested in Bat [9 60].

Cricketer 3: Weight of Bat should be greater than 10.
Maximum money he can spend = 90. So,There is no bat meeting his requirements.

Cricketer 4: Weight of Bat should be greater than 6.
Maximum money he can spend = 150. All the bats meet up his requirements and thus he would be interested in all the 4 bats.

Answer: Total number of bats which Mr. Ski can sell is 3.

NOTE : Mr. Ski would sell only one bat per cricketer.
