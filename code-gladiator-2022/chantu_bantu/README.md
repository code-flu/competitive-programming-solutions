They promised their girlfriends, Rani and Sheena that they would give them N number of gifts on their birthday. The birthday is next week and Chantu and Bantu are trying to figure out a way to make them happy.


They went to a gift shop which consists of G number of gifts and now need your help to determine the minimum money they will have to arrange to buy N gifts. Once you tell them the amount of money required, they will plan out something to arrange for the money. Can you help them figure out the minimum money required to buy N gifts?

Constraints
1<= T <=10

1<= G <=100000

1<= N <=G

0<= Price of Gift <=10000000
